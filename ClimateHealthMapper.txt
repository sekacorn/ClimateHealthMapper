ClimateHealthMapper
ClimateHealthMapper is a production-ready, modular, full-stack web application designed to mitigate the health impacts of climate change by integrating environmental data (e.g., air quality, temperature from NOAA, EPA), health data (e.g., FHIR-compliant EHRs), and genomic data (e.g., VCF files from 23andMe) to provide personalized health risk assessments, 3D climate-health visualizations, and collaborative tools. It empowers individuals, healthcare providers, and policymakers, particularly in vulnerable regions like Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, to address WHO’s projected 250,000 annual deaths from climate-related health issues by 2050. Built with open-source technologies, it ensures global accessibility, supports all 16 MBTI user types (ENTJ, INFP, INFJ, ESTP, INTJ, INTP, ISTJ, ESFJ, ISFP, ENTP, ISFJ, ESFP, ENFJ, ESTJ, ISTP, INFP), and aligns with tools like QGIS and FHIR-compliant systems without proprietary code. The application leverages AI for health risk predictions, Three.js for 3D visualizations, and LLMs for intuitive queries, advancing humanity by fostering climate-resilient health solutions.
🌍 Purpose and Impact
    • Addresses Climate-Health Nexus: Combines environmental, health, and genomic data to predict and mitigate climate-related health risks (e.g., respiratory issues, heatstroke).
    • Inclusive Design: Tailors interfaces for all 16 MBTI types, ensuring usability for diverse users.
    • Global Accessibility: Open-source architecture enables deployment in low-resource settings, with multilingual support for diverse regions.
    • Unique Value: Unlike QGIS (geospatial analysis) or FHIR systems (health data), ClimateHealthMapper integrates environmental, health, and genomic data with AI, 3D visualizations, and collaboration for personalized and community-level health solutions.
🛠️ Key Features
    1. Data Integration:
        ◦ Aggregates environmental data (CSV/JSON from NOAA, EPA), health data (FHIR-compliant EHRs), and genomic data (VCF from 23andMe, AncestryDNA).
        ◦ Supports CSV, JSON, FHIR, and VCF formats for compatibility with QGIS and FHIR systems.
        ◦ Validates inputs to ensure data integrity.
    2. 3D Visualization:
        ◦ Renders interactive 3D climate-health maps (e.g., air quality impact zones) and genomic susceptibility visualizations (e.g., disease risk heatmaps) using Three.js.
        ◦ Supports zoom/pan controls and exports as PNG/SVG/STL for reports or 3D printing.
        ◦ Tailors visuals for all 16 MBTI types (e.g., strategic for ENTJ, creative for INFP).
    3. AI-Driven Health Risk Predictions:
        ◦ Uses PyTorch to predict health risks (e.g., asthma exacerbation due to air quality) and personalized interventions based on environmental, health, and genomic data.
        ◦ Provides individual and community-level recommendations (e.g., “Relocate outdoor activities during high PM2.5 levels”).
    4. Natural Language Queries via LLM:
        ◦ Integrates an LLM (xAI API or Hugging Face Transformers) for queries like:
            ▪ “What’s my health risk from local air quality?” (ENTJ: strategic advice)
            ▪ “How can I protect my community from heatwaves?” (INFJ: empathetic solutions)
            ▪ “Quick health tips for my genetic profile!” (ESTP: actionable steps)
        ◦ Supports troubleshooting (e.g., “Why is my FHIR data import failing?”).
    5. Real-Time Collaboration:
        ◦ Enables individuals, healthcare providers, and policymakers to collaborate via WebSocket, sharing health risk assessments and mitigation plans.
        ◦ Supports MBTI-tailored collaboration (e.g., leadership tools for ENTJ, empathy for INFJ).
    6. Computing Resource Monitoring:
        ◦ Monitors CPU/memory/GPU usage for 3D rendering and AI predictions, with dynamic multithreading (ExecutorService, multiprocessing) based on resource availability.
    7. Troubleshooting Support:
        ◦ Provides manual and LLM-assisted debugging for data imports, visualizations, and predictions, with MBTI-specific guidance (e.g., detailed logs for INTJ, quick fixes for ESTP).
    8. Compatibility with Existing Tools:
        ◦ Mimics QGIS’s geospatial visualizations and FHIR’s health data workflows using open-source tools (Three.js, BioPython).
        ◦ Supports CSV, JSON, FHIR, and VCF formats for seamless integration.
